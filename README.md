Semantic SEO for OXID eShops

Semantox is an extension for ontology-based semantic annotation of product and offer data in OXID eShops. It is based on the GoodRelations vocabulary (http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1) and extends product details pages with machine-readable data. This data contains product, offer, delivery, payment, and warranty specifications. Semantox also supports the annotation of the business entity that is running the respective OXID eShop. It also includes information on store locations and opening hours. Search engines like Google and Yahoo already support the GoodRelations vocabulary (see http://bit.ly/a0qD2K and http://yhoo.it/Bh3GA). They are able to extract GoodRelations-based semantic annotations and partially use them for their search engine result pages at this stage (for example, see http://bit.ly/jf2NId).
